A very rough doc for the ActivityStream activity.

ActivityItem: An object with:

domain: The domain name of the service which provided this message (eg
        "twitter.com")

id: An ID of the message.  Only makes sense in the context of the service
    providing the item, so should be treated as a BLOB.

from: An array of PoCo records, with element 0 being the original sender.
      Usually will have exactly one record, but may have more - eg, in the
      case of a twitter re-tweet.  In the re-tweet example, element 0 will be
      the initial user (who you may not be following) and element 1 will be
      the person who re-tweeted it (who presumably you are following).

text: The raw text from the stream.  May or may not include any links shared
      (eg, will include the link if this is a tweet, will probably not if
      shared from facebook)

urls: An array of SharedUrl objects.

inReplyTo: A 2 element array of [domain, id].  If 'domain' is
           undefined or null, the same service as this item is assumed.

when: A string in RFCXXX format.


SharedUrl: An object with:

url: The full 'canonical' URL (ie, the non-shortened version)
shortUrl: If undefined, the 'url' was shared directly, otherwise the short
           version of the URL that was included in the ActivityItem.
[note - twitter has some cool things, such as the position in the message the
url was entered.]
