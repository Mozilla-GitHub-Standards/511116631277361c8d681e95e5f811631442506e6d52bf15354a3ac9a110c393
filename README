This repo contains the revised code originally meant for landing into fx5.  It
has been reverted to a restartless addon but based on work from
https://hg.mozilla.org/users/pweitershausen_mozilla.com/fx-share/

This currently requires the use of the server-share repo, but will move towards
an OWA client-side only addon.

For development, you should change the settings:

services.share.settingsURL=http://linkdrop.caraveo.com:5001/dev/1/settings/
services.share.shareURL=http://linkdrop.caraveo.com:5001/dev/1/share/panel/
